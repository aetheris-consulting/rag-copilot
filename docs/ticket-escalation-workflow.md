# Ticket Escalation Workflow — End User to ITSM

## Purpose
Safely transition unresolved or privileged requests to human operators.

---

## Escalation Triggers
- Missing or conflicting SOP guidance
- Requests requiring privileged access
- Ambiguous or high-risk intent
- Repeated failed self-service attempts

---

## Escalation Steps

1. Confirm escalation requirement
2. Collect minimal necessary context
3. Redact or avoid sensitive data
4. Create ITSM ticket
5. Return ticket number and expectations to user

---

## Design Constraints
- Copilot does not resolve tickets
- Copilot does not expose ITSM KB content
- Human authority is preserved
